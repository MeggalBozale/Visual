CSCI Project which I started, coded with vigor, and then burnt out on within a week. ayy lmao

If you wanna improve\use it go ahead. Just tell me you did so I can gawk at it!

I made this project very compartmentalized so if you wanna use a file for another project also go ahead.
The most usable parts are `listener.py` which listens for user input on another thread and exits upon keypress determined by `config.quit`
& `pencil.py` which writes stuff to the terminal in a cleaner fashion. All of it has use though!
