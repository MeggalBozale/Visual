  # What is VISUAL?
  VISUAL is a indie python project for viewing fairly common images and gifs in the command line terminal. It has many customizable options (seen below) and even an interactive image viewing mode! More is surely to come.

  ## How do I use this program?
  It's pretty simple! Simply download the files and enter the same directory as file **visual.py**. This is the main file for the project! Once that's done, execute the file using version python3 or higher like `python3.8 visual.py`. If you supply `-h` or `--help`, a descriptive menu for how to use the program will be generated.

  Generally, the format will be in `python3.8 visual.py <options> <file>`. Upon running it, compatible image/GIF files will be played in the terminal!

  ## Something's not working!
  Oops! That's likely to happen. This project is very early in development. Please put an issue into the repo issues page explaining what you did and what resulted. **It's likely that this program will not work if the environment is not linux.** I'm working on that!

  Unfortunately, I'm not an experienced developer, so I don't have best practices in mind or years of experience in *insert language here*. The code will be messy and hard to read at times. However, I tried very hard to make this program modular, modifiable, and fairly straightforward, so it's not going to suffer much (hopefully) from spaghetti code.

  ## Can I contribute?
  Maybe. The main focus of this project is for me to learn, not to create any sort of utility, though it is satisfying to see it as so. If you have anything you'd like to add, I'd love to see a PR explaining what it does, why it does it, and how I can learn to apply said practice elsewhere!
